# stx-mongo

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#262](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-krepo/pull/262) [`e7a0481`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-krepo/commit/e7a0481579ce8626699bd8091dda570c4741fc9f) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - Keyset paging no longer drops documents whose sort field is null, missing or a dotted path, a page size is capped at 1000 (`?size=` is coerced down to it), the Mongo audit trail records the signed-in author, writes entries in save order and refuses a duplicate version, and an upstream's unlisted status code such as 522 no longer throws.

### Patch Changes

- [#250](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-krepo/pull/250) [`a532490`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-krepo/commit/a532490c89e008572840e11ec4e1350b69056fd6) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - The server dependencies move to their latest patch and minor releases: Ktor 3.6.0, the MongoDB driver 5.13.0, Kafka clients 4.4.0, the RabbitMQ client 5.37.0, Hibernate Validator 9.1.5 and KotlinPoet 2.4.0. Lettuce stays at 7.7 and kotlinx.serialization at the toolchain's 1.11.0.

- [#250](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-krepo/pull/250) [`a532490`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-krepo/commit/a532490c89e008572840e11ec4e1350b69056fd6) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - kotlin-reflect moves to 2.4.20, matching the Kotlin stdlib the toolchain ships, and classgraph (classpath scanning in stx-jpa) moves from 4.8 to 6.0.0, a major release of that dependency that needs JDK 25, so a consumer that calls classgraph 4 APIs directly has to move too.
- Updated dependencies [[`e7a0481`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-krepo/commit/e7a0481579ce8626699bd8091dda570c4741fc9f), [`a532490`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-krepo/commit/a532490c89e008572840e11ec4e1350b69056fd6), [`e7a0481`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-krepo/commit/e7a0481579ce8626699bd8091dda570c4741fc9f), [`e7a0481`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-krepo/commit/e7a0481579ce8626699bd8091dda570c4741fc9f)]:

This is the release line for `io.github.softistx:stx-mongo`, `io.github.softistx:stx-mongo-ktor` and `io.github.softistx:stx-mongo-spring` — the **stx-mongo** family. They carry one version between them and ship together.

Everything through **0.2.1** was released in lockstep with every other library in this repository,
under one shared version and one shared changelog. That history is in
[the root `CHANGELOG.md`](../../../CHANGELOG.md); this file starts where it stops.
