# Native interoperability (cinterop)

Kotlin/Native provides the `cinterop` tool to facilitate interaction with C and Objective-C libraries. The Kotlin Toolchain supports `cinterop` out of the box with zero configuration for the common use case.

## Basic usage

To add a C or Objective-C interop to your multiplatform module:

1. Create a `cinterop` directory in your module root (alongside `src` and `test`).
2. Drop your [`.def` files](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-definition-file.html) into this directory.

The Kotlin Toolchain will automatically detect these files and configure the `cinterop` tool for all applicable native platforms. **No additional configuration in your `module.yaml` is required**.

## Platform-specific definitions

You can use the [`@<platform>` qualifier](../../multiplatform/#platform-qualifier) for the `cinterop` directory to limit interop definitions to specific platforms or platform families.

> **At the file level vs. directory level**

The `.def` file format already supports platform-specific configuration for the library, for example: `compilerOpts.linux` vs. `compilerOpts.osx`.

So it is possible to use a single `.def` file in the common `cinterop` directory instead of having separate platform-specific files under, e.g., `cinterop@linux` and `cinterop@macos`. Both approaches are currently valid - use the one you prefer.

## Bundled C headers (`include` directory)

If your interop needs C header files that are not available on the system (for example, headers vendored alongside your module), you can place them in an `include` directory next to your `.def` files.

The Kotlin Toolchain will automatically detect this directory and pass it to the `cinterop` tool as an additional header search path (equivalent to passing `-I<path-to-include>` as a compiler option). No configuration in your `module.yaml` is required.

## Advanced usage

If you need the `.def` file generated or provisioned (for example, to implement custom library location or provisioning logic), you can write a [plugin](../../plugins/overview/) for this. See the [relevant docs](../../plugins/topics/tasks/#contributing-back-to-the-build) for more details on how to contribute `cinteropDefinitions`.
