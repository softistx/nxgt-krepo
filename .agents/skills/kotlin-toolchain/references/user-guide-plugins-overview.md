# Plugins in the Kotlin Toolchain

> **Important**

1. It is a preview, and things are guaranteed to change. Try it out and give us your feedback!
2. Support for KMP is limited; the current preview is focused on JVM-only projects mostly. We may cover KMP scenarios better as the plugin subsystem evolves.

You can read this functionality summary or jump right into the [Quick Start guide](../quick-start/).

## Ideas at the core of the preview

Conceptually, any Kotlin Toolchain plugin consists of two parts:

1. A **configurable** part that is quick to read and fully exempt from arbitrary code execution:
  - `plugin.yaml`
  - `@TaskAction` function signatures, `@Configurable` interfaces, and enums
2. An **executable** part that contains arbitrary task‑action implementation code:
  - Normal code in `src/`, including its dependencies — other local modules and libraries

The *configurable* part is used to quickly and safely build the project model for tooling in a *traceable* way. This way we can make **project import safe and nearly transparent** and provide **user‑friendly, actionable diagnostics** that lead to **precise problem locations** — for example, why tasks are wired the way they are, or why certain Maven dependencies are added one way or another. Consequently, this part has limited expressiveness; we are exploring how minimal it can be while remaining useful.

On the other hand, the *executable* part is only needed at build execution time and has no significant restrictions.

## Summary of what is currently extensible

Plugins can currently extend the build with custom build actions — [tasks](../topics/tasks/). Such tasks can receive [configuration](../topics/configuration/), consume file‑system locations (`Path`s), or produce them. They can *contribute* specific typed entities to the build and/or *consume* them from the build. Tasks can also serve as [checks](../topics/checks/) and [commands](../topics/custom-commands/).

Task actions can consume:

- [Typed contents](../topics/tasks/#consuming-things-from-the-build) from the build:
  - module sources/resources (via built‑in `ModuleSources` configurable, e.g., `${module.kotlinJavaSources}`/`${module.resources}`)
  - module compilation result (via built‑in `CompilationArtifact` configurable, e.g., `${module.jar}`)
  - module runtime/compilation classpath (via built‑in `Classpath` configurable, e.g., `${module.runtimeClasspath}`/`${module.compileClasspath}`)
  - resolve arbitrary Maven dependencies as an ad hoc classpath (via a custom `Classpath` configuration, like `myClasspath: \[ "group:name:version", ... \]`)
- arbitrary file trees via specified paths

Task actions can produce:

- [Typed contents](../topics/tasks/#contributing-back-to-the-build) declared in the top‑level `generated:` block:
  - Kotlin/Java sources (via `generated.sources`)
  - resources (via `generated.resources`)
  - cinterop definition files (via `generated.cinteropDefinitions`)
- arbitrary file trees in specified paths

For more information on these features, see the KDocs on these built‑in configurable interfaces.

## Missing functionality

### Planned for upcoming releases

- Packaging and publishing plugins
- Bundled module templates in plugins to contribute to the configuration of the modules they are enabled in
- A simpler way of authoring trivial plugins consisting of a single task, template, etc.
- Dependencies between plugins

### We may consider providing solutions for

- Supporting conditionals/loops in the declarative configuration
- Alternatives to YAML as the configuration language
