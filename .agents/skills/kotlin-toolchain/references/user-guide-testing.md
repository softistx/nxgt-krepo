# Testing

Test code is located in the `test/` folder:

```
├─ src/            # production code
├─ test/           # test code
│  ├─ MainTest.kt
│  ╰─ ...
├─ testResources/  # test resources
╰─ module.yaml
```

Resources that should only be available to test code go into the `testResources/` folder. In multiplatform modules, platform-specific test resources can be placed in `testResources@platform/` folders, just like `src@platform/` folders for sources.

By default, the [Kotlin test](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/kotlin.test/) framework is preconfigured for each platform.

> **JUnit version**

On the JVM and Android platforms, tests run with JUnit, and JUnit 5 is used by default. You can change this with the `settings.junit` setting, which accepts `junit-5`, `junit-4`, or `none`. This setting also selects which flavor of the Kotlin test library is added automatically: `kotlin-test-junit5`, `kotlin-test-junit`, or just `kotlin-test`, respectively. See the [`settings.junit` reference](../../reference/module/#settingsjunit) for more details.

Additional test-only dependencies should be added to the `test-dependencies:` section of your module configuration file:

module.yaml

```yaml
product: jvm/app

# these dependencies are available in main and test code
dependencies:
  - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0

# additional dependencies for test code
test-dependencies:
  - io.ktor:ktor-server-test-host:2.2.0
```

To add or override [toolchain settings](../basics/#settings) in tests, use the `test-settings:` section: module.yaml

```yaml
# these dependencies are available in main and test code
settings:
  kotlin:
    ...

# additional test-specific setting
test-settings:
  kotlin:
    ...
```

Test settings and dependencies by default are inherited from the main configuration according to the [configuration propagation rules](../multiplatform/#dependencysettings-propagation). Example: 

```
├─ src/
├─ src@ios/
├─ test/           # Sees declarations from src/. Executed on all platforms.
│  ├─ MainTest.kt
│  ╰─ ...
├─ test@ios/       # Sees declarations from src/, src@ios/, and `test/`. Executed on iOS platforms only.
│  ├─ IOSTest.kt
│  ╰─ ...
╰─ module.yaml
```

module.yaml

```yaml
product:
  type: kmp/lib
  platforms: [android, iosArm64]

# these dependencies are available in main and test code
dependencies:
  - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0

# dependencies for test code
test-dependencies:
  - org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test:1.8.10

# these settings affect the main and test code
settings:
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 2.1

# these settings affect tests only
test-settings:
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 2.2 # overrides settings.kotlin.languageVersion 2.1
```
